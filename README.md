# Recording Server
> Intergrate [Agora Recording SDK](https://docs.agora.io/cn/2.1.1/addons/Recording/Quickstart%20Guides/recording_c++?platform=C%2B%2B) to provide RESTful API for recording control 

## How to use

First, you should go to [Agora Recording SDK](https://docs.agora.io/cn/2.1.1/addons/Recording/Quickstart%20Guides/recording_c++?platform=C%2B%2B) to download our Recording SDK. Unzip and rename it as 'Agora_EDU_Recording_SDK_for_Linux', then put it under this project.

Then just install dependency and start server.js with [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2/).
In default it will run at port 3233.

```bash
# install dependency
npm install
# e.g. use pm2 to start server
pm2 start server.js
```
